# Live Alumni to Raisers Edge

This is a web-app developed on Python and mostly using streamlit library. It's objective is to let the user upload CSV 
files from the Blackbaud's Raisers Edge and Live Alumni application to essentially compare the data, identify the delta 
that is missing in Raisers Edge and let the user download this so that it can be uploaded to Raisers Edge using its 
Database view.
